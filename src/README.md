Our game is a draw something Clone. To play the game you must first run the DrawSomthing.java. 
Once this is done you will be connected to a server where you will be placed in the lobby.

in the lobby you can chat with other players in the lobby create a new game or join an existing game. 

There are three Menu Options:
	Create Game - Creates a new drawSomthing game.
	Join Game - Joins an existing game.
	Leave Game - Leaves whatever game the player is in. NOTE: should not be used in lobby.
	Exit Program - closes the game.

If you create a game you must wait for at least one other player to join before the game can begin. Joining a game will allow you to start to play at once.
Once enough players have joined the game will start. The first player in the room will be given a choice between three words to draw.
Once the player makes his/her selection the drawing bar will be unlocked and the player may beginning to draw his/her selection.

Players guess by entering what they think is being drawn into the messaging bar. NOTE: this bar is chat so guesses will be broadcasted to all players.
Once a correct guess has been achieved the server will inform all players that the given guess was correct and the next player will be chosen to draw.

There is no end to this game. It is fun FOREVER! At the very least it is fun while there are enough players to play. Once you are tired of playing just leave the game.
